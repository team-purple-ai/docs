# Core concepts

Before diving deep into p0, familiarize yourself with the key concepts that shape how you work with the AI coding assistant. These building blocks work together to create a safe, productive development workflow.

## Foundational concepts

  <Card title="Workspaces" icon="folder-tree" href="/workspaces/overview">
    ### Workspaces

    A workspace is a container for one or more git repositories, along with shared settings, coding standards, and plugins. Workspaces let you:

    - Work across multiple repos in a unified environment
    - Define project-wide conventions and preferences
    - Share context between sessions
    - Install workspace-scoped plugins

    Think of a workspace as your project's home base in p0.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sessions" icon="comments" href="/sessions/plan-mode">
    ### Sessions

    A session represents a single coding task within a workspace. Each session:

    - Gets its own isolated git worktree for safety
    - Has a dedicated chat thread for communication
    - Can run in Plan mode (read-only) or Agent mode (full execution)
    - Tracks all changes and tool executions

    Sessions keep your work organized and your main branch protected.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Modes" icon="toggle-on" href="/sessions/plan-mode">
    ### Plan vs Agent modes

    p0 operates in two distinct modes:

    **Plan mode** (read-only):
    - Analyzes your codebase without making changes
    - Generates detailed implementation plans
    - Researches files and dependencies
    - Safe for exploration and brainstorming

    **Agent mode** (execution):
    - Implements changes using real tools
    - Runs bash commands, edits files, searches the web
    - Shows real-time tool output
    - Creates commits and manages git

    Start with Plan, switch to Agent when ready.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Spec-driven workflow" icon="list-check" href="/workflow/overview">
    ### Spec-driven workflow

    p0 follows a five-phase pipeline for complex features:

    1. **Product spec**: Define what you're building and why
    2. **Tech spec**: Plan the technical implementation
    3. **Implementation**: Execute the changes
    4. **Pull request**: Review and merge
    5. **Post-PR**: Follow-up tasks and refinements

    This structured approach ensures quality at every step.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tools" icon="wrench" href="/tools/overview">
    ### Real-time tools

    When running in Agent mode, p0 uses tools to interact with your codebase:

    - **Bash**: Run terminal commands
    - **File operations**: Read, write, edit files
    - **Web search**: Research APIs and documentation
    - **Git operations**: Commit, branch, diff

    Every tool execution is visible in real-time with full output, giving you complete transparency into what p0 is doing.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sub-chats" icon="message" href="/sessions/sub-chats">
    ### Sub-chats

    Complex sessions can have multiple conversation threads called sub-chats:

    - Break large tasks into focused discussions
    - Work on parallel concerns simultaneously
    - Keep related context together
    - Switch between threads without losing progress

    Sub-chats help manage complexity in long-running sessions.
  </Card>

## How it all fits together

Here's how these concepts work together in a typical p0 workflow:

1. You create a **workspace** for your project and add repositories
2. You start a **session** for a specific task (e.g., "Add user authentication")
3. p0 operates in **Plan mode** to analyze and create a plan
4. You review the plan and switch to **Agent mode** for execution
5. p0 uses **tools** (bash, file edits) to implement changes in an isolated git worktree
6. For complex features, you follow the **spec-driven workflow** with multiple phases
7. You use **sub-chats** to work on different aspects in parallel
8. When complete, you review the diff and create a pull request

## Git worktree isolation

One of p0's most important safety features is git worktree isolation. Each session runs in its own worktree, which means:

- Your main branch stays clean and untouched
- Multiple sessions can run concurrently without conflicts
- You can experiment freely without risk
- Failed sessions don't pollute your workspace

## Available models

p0 is powered by Anthropic's Claude models. You can switch between models using the `/model` command or the model selector in the chat header:

- **Claude Sonnet** — fast, efficient performance for most coding tasks (default)
- **Claude Opus** — maximum capability for complex reasoning and planning
- **Claude Haiku** — lightweight model for quick tasks

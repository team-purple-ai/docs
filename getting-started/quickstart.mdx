# Quickstart

This guide walks you through your first p0 session, from creating a workspace to reviewing your AI-generated changes. You'll be coding with Claude in minutes.

## Your first session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to p0">
    Open the p0 desktop app and enter your Purple account credentials (email and password). If you don't have an account, sign up at [bepurple.ai](https://bepurple.ai).

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the workspace creation wizard showing template selection */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a workspace">
    Click **New workspace** to launch the workspace creation wizard.

    - Choose a workspace template or start from scratch
    - Give your workspace a name (e.g., "My Project")
    - Add one or more git repositories from your local machine
    - Configure coding standards and preferences (optional)

    p0 will analyze your repositories and set up the workspace structure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start in Plan mode">
    Once your workspace is ready, describe what you want to build in the chat interface. For example:

    > "Add a new user authentication endpoint with JWT tokens"

    p0 starts in **Plan mode** by default, which means it will:
    - Analyze your codebase to understand existing patterns
    - Research relevant files and dependencies
    - Create a detailed plan without making any changes

      <img src="/images/screenshots/plan-mode-interface.png" alt="Plan mode showing analysis and plan" />
    </Frame>

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture Plan mode showing the chat with analysis results and generated plan */}

    Review the plan carefully. You'll see which files will be modified, what commands will run, and the overall approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to Agent mode">
    If the plan looks good, switch to **Agent mode** to let p0 implement the changes:

    - Click the **Switch to Agent mode** button in the session header
    - p0 will execute the plan using real tools: bash commands, file edits, web searches
    - Watch in real-time as each tool runs and see the output immediately

    You can pause, provide feedback, or adjust the approach at any time during execution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and create a PR">
    Once implementation is complete, review the session diff to see all changes:

    - Check modified files in the diff viewer
    - Run tests to verify the implementation
    - When satisfied, click **Create PR** to push your changes

    p0 runs in its own git worktree, so your main branch stays clean throughout the process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Always start with Plan mode to understand what changes p0 will make before committing to them. You can iterate on the plan by asking follow-up questions or requesting adjustments.
</Tip>

## What you just learned

In this quickstart, you:

- Created a workspace and connected your repositories
- Used Plan mode to analyze your codebase and generate a plan
- Switched to Agent mode to execute changes with full visibility
- Reviewed the diff and prepared to create a pull request

This workflow works for any coding task: new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, and more.

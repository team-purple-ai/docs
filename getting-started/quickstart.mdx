# Quickstart

This guide walks you through your first p0 session, from creating a workspace to reviewing your AI-generated changes. You'll be coding with Claude in minutes.

## Your first session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to p0">
    Open the p0 desktop app and sign in with your Purple account (email and password). If you don't have an account, switch to the **Create Account** tab to register.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a workspace">
    Click **New** in the workspace picker to launch the creation wizard. The wizard walks you through:

    1. **Template** — pick a starting template (Full Stack, Backend, Frontend, etc.) or start blank
    2. **Team** — select which Purple team owns this workspace (auto-skipped if you belong to one team)
    3. **Name** — give your workspace a name. p0 creates a folder at `~/.purple-code/workspaces/{name}/` automatically
    4. **Repositories** — browse and select GitHub repositories to include (optional, you can add repos later)
    5. **Plugins** — choose workspace plugins (optional)
    6. **Review** — confirm your selections and create the workspace

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the workspace creation wizard at the template selection step */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start in Plan mode">
    Once your workspace is ready, describe what you want to build in the chat interface. For example:

    > "Add a new user authentication endpoint with JWT tokens"

    p0 starts in **Plan mode** by default, which means it will:
    - Analyze your codebase to understand existing patterns
    - Research relevant files and dependencies
    - Create a detailed plan without making any changes

    </Frame>

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture Plan mode showing the chat with analysis results and generated plan */}

    Review the plan carefully. You'll see which files will be modified, what commands will run, and the overall approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to Agent mode">
    If the plan looks good, switch to **Agent mode** to let p0 implement the changes:

    - Type `/agent` in the chat or use the mode toggle in the session header
    - p0 will execute the plan using real tools: bash commands, file edits, web searches
    - Watch in real-time as each tool runs and see the output immediately

    You can pause, provide feedback, or adjust the approach at any time during execution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and create a PR">
    Once implementation is complete, review the session diff to see all changes:

    - Check modified files in the diff viewer
    - Run tests to verify the implementation
    - When satisfied, click **Create PR** to push your changes

    p0 runs in its own git worktree, so your main branch stays clean throughout the process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Always start with Plan mode to understand what changes p0 will make before committing to them. You can iterate on the plan by asking follow-up questions or requesting adjustments.
</Tip>

## What you just learned

In this quickstart, you:

- Created a workspace and connected your repositories
- Used Plan mode to analyze your codebase and generate a plan
- Switched to Agent mode to execute changes with full visibility
- Reviewed the diff and prepared to create a pull request

This workflow works for any coding task: new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, and more.

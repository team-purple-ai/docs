Purple takes security and privacy seriously. Here's how p0 handles your data.

## Data Handling

- **Session data**: Stored locally in SQLite using better-sqlite3
- **Workspace configuration**: Stored at `~/.purple-code/`
- **Code context**: Sent to Anthropic's Claude API for AI processing
- **No server storage**: No code is stored on Purple's servers beyond what's needed for the API call

All your coding sessions, chat history, and workspace settings remain on your local machine.

## Encryption

All API communication between p0 and Purple's services uses HTTPS/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.

## Environment Security

Terminal sessions use an allowlist-based environment filter. Only safe variables (PATH, HOME, etc.) are passed to terminal processes.

App secrets and sensitive environment variables are never exposed to terminal sessions, protecting your credentials and API keys.

## Analytics

p0 uses PostHog for anonymous usage analytics to help improve the product. Analytics data includes:

- Feature usage patterns
- Performance metrics
- Error rates

**You can opt out** in Settings > Preferences by enabling "Analytics opt-out".

## Error Tracking

p0 includes optional Sentry integration for crash reporting. This helps Purple identify and fix bugs quickly.

Error reports may include:
- Stack traces
- App state at time of error
- Device information (OS version, app version)

Error reports do not include your code or workspace contents.

## Telemetry Opt-Out

To disable analytics tracking:

1. Open Settings (`Cmd+,` or `Ctrl+,`)
2. Go to Preferences
3. Enable "Analytics opt-out"

This will stop all analytics data collection while continuing to provide full app functionality.

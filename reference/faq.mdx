Answers to common questions about p0.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What AI model does p0 use?">
    p0 uses Claude by Anthropic. You can choose between:

    - **Opus 4.5**: The most capable model, best for complex reasoning and challenging tasks
    - **Sonnet 4.5**: Balanced performance and speed, set as the default

    Change your model preference in Settings > Model.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my code sent to the cloud?">
    Code context is sent to Anthropic's API for processing by Claude. This is necessary for the AI to understand and work with your code.

    No code is stored on Purple's servers beyond what's needed for the API call. See [Security & Privacy](/reference/security-and-privacy) for complete details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use p0 offline?">
    p0 requires an internet connection for AI features, as Claude runs in the cloud.

    The terminal and file browsing work offline, but you won't be able to get AI assistance without connectivity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming languages are supported?">
    p0 works with any programming language that Claude supports, which includes all major languages:

    JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and many more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own API key?">
    p0 uses Purple's managed API access. You don't need your own Anthropic API key.

    Your Purple subscription includes API access as part of the service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do worktrees affect my git history?">
    Worktree branches are separate from your main branch. p0 creates isolated git worktrees so the AI can work without affecting your current branch.

    You choose when to merge changes back to your main branch. The worktree branches don't pollute your history unless you explicitly merge them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple people work in the same workspace?">
    Workspaces are local to your machine, but coding standards and plugins can sync via your Purple team settings.

    For collaboration, team members can each create their own workspace pointing to the same repository, and use git for coordination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update p0?">
    p0 updates automatically in the background. You'll be notified when an update is ready to install.

    Updates are seamless and don't interrupt your work. You can choose when to restart and apply the update.

p0 uses environment variables for optional configuration. Most users don't need to set any of these variables.

## API Configuration

Configure API endpoints for p0:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| MAIN_VITE_API_URL | Purple API base URL | https://api.bepurple.ai |
| MAIN_VITE_UPDATE_URL | Auto-update server URL | (Purple default) |
| VITE_FEEDBACK_URL | Feedback channel URL | (Purple default) |

## Analytics and Error Tracking

Configure analytics and error tracking services:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| MAIN_VITE_SENTRY_DSN | Sentry error tracking DSN (main process) |
| MAIN_VITE_POSTHOG_KEY | PostHog analytics key (main process) |
| MAIN_VITE_POSTHOG_HOST | PostHog host URL (main process) |
| VITE_POSTHOG_KEY | PostHog analytics key (renderer) |
| VITE_POSTHOG_HOST | PostHog host URL (renderer) |

## Apple Signing

Additional environment variables are used for Apple code signing during the build process. These are only relevant for developers building p0 from source.

<Note>
These variables are primarily for development and self-hosted deployments. The default values work for most users.

Workspaces are the foundation of your p0 development environment. A workspace is a container that bundles your repositories, coding standards, plugins, and AI preferences into a cohesive unit. Instead of managing scattered configuration files and repositories, workspaces let you organize everything your project needs in one place.

Each workspace is tailored to your team's workflow and can contain multiple repositories, making it easy to work on full-stack projects or microservice architectures where code spans several repos.

## Creating a workspace

When you create a new workspace, p0 guides you through a setup wizard that configures everything based on your project type:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a template">
    Select a template that matches your project type. Templates pre-configure coding standards and plugins for your stack:

    - **Full Stack** - Frontend and backend standards for web applications
    - **Backend API** - Node.js, Python, or Go API development
    - **Frontend Web** - React, Vue, or modern web frameworks
    - **Mobile App** - React Native or mobile-first development
    - **Data Science** - Python, Jupyter, data analysis tools
    - **E-commerce** - Online store and payment integration patterns
    - **SaaS Application** - Multi-tenant application standards
    - **DevOps & Infrastructure** - IaC, CI/CD, and deployment configs
    - **Blank Workspace** - Start from scratch with no defaults

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture template selection screen showing all template options in a grid */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your team">
    Choose which team owns this workspace. Team selection determines:
    - Who can access the workspace
    - Which shared coding standards are applied
    - Sync and collaboration settings

    </Frame>

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture team dropdown/selection interface */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your workspace">
    Give your workspace a descriptive name. p0 automatically generates a folder path at:

    ```
    ~/.purple-code/workspaces/{slugified-name}/
    ```

    The workspace name is used for organization and appears in the workspace switcher.

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture name input field with auto-generated path preview */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add repositories">
    Connect GitHub repositories to your workspace. You can:
    - Clone existing repos from GitHub
    - Add multiple repos for multi-repo projects
    - Skip this step and add repos later

    This step is optional—you can always add repositories from workspace settings after creation.

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture GitHub repo browser with search and multi-select */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select plugins">
    Choose plugins to extend p0's functionality for your workspace. Available plugins vary by template and include:
    - Database connectors
    - API testing tools
    - Deployment integrations
    - Code quality analyzers

    Like repositories, plugins can be added or removed later from settings.

    </Frame>

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture plugin grid with descriptions and toggle switches */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and create">
    Review your workspace configuration:
    - Template and standards applied
    - Connected repositories
    - Enabled plugins
    - Team and sync settings

    Click "Create Workspace" to finalize setup. p0 will initialize your workspace and clone any selected repositories.

    {/* TODO: Screenshot - capture review/summary screen with all selections listed */}
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace dashboard

After creating your workspace, you'll see the workspace dashboard—your command center for all development activity:

- **Sessions list** - View active and past coding sessions
- **Repository overview** - Quick access to all connected repos
- **Quick actions** - Start new sessions, manage settings, sync with team
- **Standards summary** - Overview of active coding standards
- **Plugin status** - See which plugins are enabled

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture full workspace dashboard view with all sections visible */}

<Tip>
  You can always add repositories and plugins later from workspace settings. Don't worry about getting everything perfect during initial setup.

title: "Multi-repo workspaces"
description: "Work across multiple repositories in a single workspace"
---

Modern software projects rarely live in a single repository. You might have a React frontend, a Node.js API, a Python analytics service, and shared component libraries—all working together as one product. p0's multi-repo workspaces let you work across all these repositories seamlessly, with the AI understanding context from your entire codebase.

## Why multi-repo support matters

Instead of juggling multiple terminal windows, VS Code workspaces, and context switching between repos, p0 treats your entire project as a unified workspace:

- **Unified AI context** - Claude sees your full stack, not just one repo
- **Cross-repo refactoring** - Update API contracts and frontend clients together
- **Shared standards** - Apply consistent coding standards across all repositories
- **Atomic sessions** - Work on features that span multiple repos in one session

## Adding repositories

You can add repositories to your workspace in two ways:

### During workspace creation

In the workspace creation wizard, the "Add repositories" step lets you browse and select GitHub repositories. You can:

- Search your GitHub organizations
- Select multiple repos at once
- Preview repository details before adding

### From workspace settings

To add repositories after workspace creation:

1. Open workspace settings (gear icon or `Cmd+,`)
2. Navigate to the "Repositories" tab
3. Click "Add Repository"
4. Select repos from GitHub or paste a Git URL
5. p0 clones the repo into your workspace

## Cross-repo context

When you start a session in a multi-repo workspace, Claude has access to all repositories. This enables powerful cross-repo operations:

**Example: API contract changes**

You ask Claude to add a new field to a user endpoint. Claude:
1. Updates the API schema in `backend-api/src/models/user.ts`
2. Modifies the API route handler
3. Updates the TypeScript types in `frontend/src/types/api.ts`
4. Adjusts UI components that display user data

All in one session, across two repositories.

**Example: Shared component updates**

You refactor a button component in your design system repo. Claude:
1. Updates the component in `design-system/src/Button.tsx`
2. Identifies all usages in `web-app/` and `admin-portal/` repos
3. Updates import paths and prop usages across both consuming apps
4. Updates documentation in the design system

<Tip>
  The AI doesn't need special instructions to work across repos—it automatically understands the relationships between your repositories based on imports, API calls, and shared code.
</Tip>

## Worktree mappings

When you start a session, p0 creates a worktree for each repository in your workspace. This allows you to work on feature branches without affecting your main working directories.

### Worktree structure

Each session gets its own worktree directory:

```
~/.purple-code/worktrees/{workspace-name}-wt-{session-id}/
├── frontend-app/           (git worktree on feature branch)
├── backend-api/            (git worktree on feature branch)
├── shared-components/      (git worktree on feature branch)
├── purple/                 (symlinked from workspace)
├── .claude/                (symlinked from workspace)
└── .workspace-root         (marker file)
```

### How worktrees work

- **Isolated branches** - Each repository gets its own feature branch for the session
- **Independent commits** - Changes to each repo are committed separately
- **Shared workspace config** - The `purple/` and `.claude/` directories are symlinked, so standards and session context are shared
- **Auto-cleanup** - Worktrees are cleaned up when sessions end (branches can be preserved or deleted)

</Frame>

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture file explorer showing a worktree directory with multiple repo folders */}

<Note>
  Each repository in the workspace gets its own git worktree branch. This means you can have `feature/add-auth` in your frontend repo and `feature/add-auth` in your backend repo—both managed in the same p0 session.
</Note>

## Repository management

From workspace settings, you can:

- **View all repos** - See connected repositories, their remotes, and current branches
- **Add repos** - Connect new repositories to the workspace
- **Remove repos** - Disconnect repos (workspace copy is preserved)
- **Update remotes** - Change Git URLs if repos are moved
- **Sync status** - See which repos have pending changes or sync issues

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep related repos together">
    Group repositories that share code, APIs, or deployment cycles in the same workspace. Separate unrelated projects into different workspaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent branch naming">
    Use the same feature branch name across repos when working on multi-repo features. This makes it easier to track related changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Apply shared standards">
    Use workspace coding standards to ensure consistency across all repositories. Set standards for API contracts, error handling, and shared patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage session isolation">
    Work on different features in separate sessions, even within the same workspace. Each session creates isolated worktrees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

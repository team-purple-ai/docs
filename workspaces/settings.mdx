Workspace settings let you customize how p0 behaves for your project. Access settings at any time by clicking the gear icon in your workspace or pressing `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux).

## Repositories

The Repositories tab shows all connected repositories and lets you manage your workspace's codebase.

### Repository list

View all repositories connected to your workspace:

- **Repository name** - GitHub repo name or local folder name
- **Git remote** - The remote URL (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- **Current branch** - The branch currently checked out
- **Status** - Indicates if there are uncommitted changes or sync issues

### Adding repositories

To connect a new repository to your workspace:

1. Click "Add Repository"
2. Choose a method:
   - **Browse GitHub** - Search and select repos from your organizations
   - **Enter Git URL** - Paste any Git remote URL
   - **Local folder** - Add an existing local repository
3. p0 clones the repository into your workspace directory
4. The repo is now available in all future sessions

### Removing repositories

To disconnect a repository:

1. Click the overflow menu (three dots) next to the repo
2. Select "Remove from workspace"
3. Choose whether to delete the local copy or keep it

<Warning>
  Removing a repository from your workspace does not delete it from GitHub—it only disconnects it from this workspace. You can re-add it later.
</Warning>

## Coding standards

Coding standards define how the AI writes code in your workspace. Standards are organized into categories and applied automatically during sessions.

### Standard categories

Your workspace can have standards in any of these categories:

- **Global** - Applies to all code regardless of stack
- **Frontend** - React, Vue, CSS, browser-specific patterns
- **Backend** - API design, database access, server-side code
- **Business** - Domain logic, business rules, workflows
- **Mobile** - React Native, mobile-first patterns
- **Data** - Data processing, analytics, ETL pipelines
- **DevOps** - CI/CD, infrastructure, deployment
- **Security** - Authentication, authorization, data protection

</Frame>

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture Coding Standards tab showing categories and standard rules */}

### How standards are applied

When you create a workspace from a template, standards are pre-configured based on your stack. For example, the "Full Stack" template includes:

- Global standards for code quality and testing
- Frontend standards for React and TypeScript
- Backend standards for Node.js APIs
- Security standards for authentication

You can customize these standards or add your own team-specific rules.

### Managing standards

From the Coding Standards tab:

- **View standards** - See all active standards by category
- **Edit standards** - Modify existing rules
- **Add custom standards** - Create team-specific patterns
- **Sync with team** - Pull updated standards from your Purple team

<Tip>
  Standards are version-controlled and sync with your team. When your team updates shared standards, you'll see a notification to pull the latest version.
</Tip>

Learn more about creating and managing coding standards in the [Coding Standards documentation](/features/coding-standards).

## Plugins

Plugins extend p0's functionality with integrations, tools, and custom AI behaviors. The Plugins tab shows installed plugins and lets you enable or disable them per workspace.

### Available plugins

Browse and install plugins for your workspace:

- **Database connectors** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB access
- **API tools** - REST client, GraphQL playground
- **Deployment** - Vercel, Netlify, AWS deploy integrations
- **Testing** - Playwright, Cypress, Jest utilities
- **Code quality** - ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture Plugins tab with grid of available plugins and enable/disable toggles */}

### Installing plugins

To add a plugin to your workspace:

1. Navigate to the Plugins tab
2. Click "Browse Plugins"
3. Select the plugin you want to install
4. Click "Install"
5. Configure plugin settings if required
6. Enable the plugin for your workspace

### Managing plugins

For each installed plugin, you can:

- **Enable/Disable** - Toggle plugins on or off for this workspace
- **Configure** - Set plugin-specific options and credentials
- **Update** - Install the latest version when available
- **Uninstall** - Remove the plugin from your workspace

<Note>
  Plugins are workspace-specific. Enabling a database plugin in one workspace doesn't automatically enable it in others.
</Note>

Learn more about plugins in the [Plugins documentation](/features/plugins).

## Team sync

Workspaces can sync with your Purple team to share settings, standards, and plugins across team members.

### Sync status

The workspace settings header shows your sync status:

- **Synced** (green checkmark) - Workspace is up to date with team settings
- **Pending** (yellow clock) - Changes are queued to sync
- **Error** (red warning) - Sync failed, manual intervention needed

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/settings-team-sync.png" alt="Team sync status in workspace settings" />
</Frame>

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture sync status indicator in settings header with tooltip */}

### What syncs with your team

When your workspace is connected to a Purple team, the following sync automatically:

- **Coding standards** - Shared team standards are pulled and merged
- **Plugin recommendations** - Team-approved plugins appear in your plugin list
- **Workspace templates** - Team-specific templates for workspace creation
- **Configuration presets** - Shared AI preferences and settings

### Manual sync

To manually sync with your team:

1. Open workspace settings
2. Click the sync icon in the header
3. Review incoming changes
4. Accept or reject team updates
5. Push your local changes to the team (if you have admin permissions)

<Warning>
  Sync conflicts can occur if you've customized standards that your team also updated. p0 will show a diff and let you choose which version to keep.
</Warning>

## Workspace metadata

At the bottom of the settings panel, you'll find workspace metadata:

- **Workspace ID** - Unique identifier for this workspace
- **Remote ID** - Server-side ID if synced with Purple team
- **Team ID** - The team this workspace belongs to
- **Created date** - When the workspace was created
- **Last modified** - Most recent settings change
- **Storage path** - Local filesystem location (`~/.purple-code/workspaces/{name}/`)

This information is useful for troubleshooting and support.

The final phase is a success screen showing your created pull requests with real-time status tracking.

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the Phase 5 success screen showing the celebration header, PR list with status badges, and the "Start New Session" button */}

## PR tracking

Each pull request is displayed with:

- **Repository name** — which repo the PR belongs to
- **PR number** — the GitHub PR number
- **Status badge** — current state of the PR:
  - **Open** — PR is open and awaiting review
  - **Merged** — PR has been merged
  - **Closed** — PR was closed without merging

### Actions per PR

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **View PR** | Opens the pull request in your browser on GitHub |
| **Check Status** | Polls GitHub for the current PR state and updates the badge |
| **Retry** | Re-creates the PR if the original creation failed |

## Failed PRs

If a PR fails to create (e.g., due to network issues or authentication errors), the error message is displayed with a retry button. You can retry individual failed PRs without affecting successful ones.

## Starting a new feature

Click **Start New Session** to create a fresh session and return to Phase 1. Your completed feature's documentation remains in the feature folder for reference:

```
purple/documentation/{YYMMDD}-{slug}/
├── product-spec.md
├── technical-spec.md
├── progress.json
├── manual-setup.md
├── agent-written-specifications/
├── completed-tickets-documentation/
└── qa-screenshots/
```

## Alternative workflows

After completing a spec-driven workflow, you can also:

- Use `/refine` for incremental changes to the same feature
- Switch to regular chat mode for exploratory work
- Start a new spec-driven workflow with `/build-from-spec`

<Note>
  The spec-driven workflow is designed for substantial features. For small tweaks and bug fixes after the PR is created, regular chat mode (Agent or Plan mode) may be more efficient.

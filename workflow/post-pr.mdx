title: "Phase 5: Post-PR"
description: "Handle review feedback and make follow-up changes"
---

After the PR is created, use p0 to address review comments and make follow-up changes. The session remains active, allowing you to iterate on the implementation until the PR is approved.

## Handling review feedback

When you receive review comments:

1. Paste the comments into p0
2. p0 analyzes the feedback and suggests fixes
3. Review the suggested changes
4. Approve or modify the approach
5. p0 implements the changes

p0 understands common review patterns:

- Code style and convention requests
- Performance improvements
- Security concerns
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation updates

## Follow-up changes

You can make additional changes in the same session:

- Add missing tests
- Improve error handling
- Refactor based on feedback
- Update documentation
- Fix edge cases

Each iteration pushes new commits to the same PR branch.

<Tip>
  Use `/pr-comments` to generate structured review comments for your own PRs when reviewing others' code.
</Tip>

## Closing the loop

Once the PR is approved and merged:

1. The feature is complete
2. The session's worktree can be cleaned up
3. Documentation is preserved in the feature folder

The feature folder remains as a permanent record:

```
purple/documentation/{YYMMDD}-{slug}/
  ├── product-spec.md
  ├── tech-spec.md
  ├── implementation-log.md
  ├── progress.json
  └── pr-link.txt
```

## Starting a new task

After completing a feature, you can:

- Start a new spec-driven workflow with `/build-from-spec`
- Use `/refine` for incremental changes to existing features
- Switch to chat mode for exploratory work

<Note>
  The spec-driven workflow is designed for substantial features. For small tweaks and bug fixes, regular chat mode may be more efficient.
</Note>

## Best practices

To get the most out of the post-PR phase:

- Address feedback promptly while context is fresh
- Group related review comments for batch fixes
- Test thoroughly after each iteration
- Keep PR scope focused; create new PRs for scope expansion
- Document any decisions made during review

## Workflow complete

Congratulations! You've completed the full spec-driven workflow. The feature has gone from idea to merged PR with full documentation at every step.

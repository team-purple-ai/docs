The import phase is your starting point. Upload the product spec that defines what you're building, along with optional technical details and visual references.

## Import panel

When you start a spec-driven session, you'll see the import panel with three zones:

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the Phase 1 import panel showing the three drag-and-drop zones for product spec, tech spec, and visual references */}

### Product spec (required)

The product spec defines what you're building. You can:

- **Drag and drop** a `.md`, `.txt`, or `.markdown` file onto the upload zone
- **Browse files** from your workspace's `user-originals` folder
- **Brainstorm with AI** to start from scratch and generate a spec interactively

### Technical spec (optional)

If you already have implementation details planned out, upload a technical spec to give the AI more context about how to build the feature.

### Visual references (optional)

Upload images to provide visual context:

- Drag and drop image files onto the references zone
- Use a file picker to browse for images
- Paste images directly with `Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux)

Visual references help the AI understand UI layouts, design mockups, or error screenshots.

## Work mode selection

Before proceeding, choose your work mode:

- **Worktree** (recommended) — creates an isolated git worktree so changes don't affect your main branch
- **Local** — works directly in your project directory

<Tip>
  Worktree mode is the default and recommended for safety. Your main branch stays clean while the AI works on a separate branch.
</Tip>

## Moving to Phase 2

Once you've uploaded at least a product spec, click **Continue to refine** to move to Phase 2 where you can polish your specs with AI assistance.

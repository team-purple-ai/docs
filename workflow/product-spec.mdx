The product spec captures requirements in a structured format that guides all subsequent phases. A well-written product spec ensures everyone understands what needs to be built before any code is written.

## Creating a product spec

You have two options for creating a product spec:

### Import an existing spec

Use `/import-spec` to import a spec you've already written. p0 supports various formats and will help you structure it into the standard template.

### Generate a new spec

Describe your feature to p0 in natural language, and it will generate a structured product spec for you. You can iterate on this together until it captures your requirements accurately.

### Spec template

Every product spec follows this structure:

- **Overview**: High-level description of the feature
- **User Stories**: Who needs this and why
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for completion
- **Technical Notes**: Any constraints, dependencies, or considerations

## Reviewing the spec

p0 presents the spec for your review in a readable format. You can:

- Edit sections directly
- Ask for more detail in specific areas
- Add edge cases or constraints
- Approve and move to the next phase

<Tip>
  The more detail you provide in the product spec, the better the implementation will be. Take time to think through edge cases and acceptance criteria.
</Tip>

## Spec storage

Once approved, the product spec is saved to:

- `purple/documentation/user-originals/` (permanent storage)
- `purple/documentation/{YYMMDD}-{slug}/product-spec.md` (feature folder)

The feature folder becomes the central hub for all documentation related to this feature.

## Next steps

After the product spec is approved, p0 can automatically generate a tech spec or you can proceed to Phase 2 manually.

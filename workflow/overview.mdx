description: "Take features from idea to pull request through a structured five-phase pipeline"
---

p0's spec-driven workflow guides you from product requirements through implementation to pull request, keeping every step documented and reviewable. This structured approach ensures clarity at each stage and makes complex features manageable.

## The five phases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import">
    Upload your product spec (required), optional tech spec, and visual references
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine">
    Polish your specs with AI assistance in a split-screen editor and chat interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch">
    AI implements the spec automatically while you monitor progress with a live ticket tree
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Review the implementation and complete any manual setup steps before creating PRs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-PR">
    Track PR status, retry failed PRs, and start new features
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting started

To start a spec-driven workflow, create a new session in your workspace. You'll see the import screen where you can upload your product spec or start from scratch with AI brainstorming.

You can also use these slash commands to enter the workflow at any point:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/build-from-spec` | Run the full pipeline from spec to implementation to QA |
| `/import-spec` | Import and validate a product spec |
| `/engineer-tasks` | Generate an engineering plan from a product spec |
| `/orchestrate` | Run parallel implementation of an engineering spec |

## Feature folders

All specs and documentation are organized in feature folders within your workspace:

```
purple/documentation/{YYMMDD}-{slug}/
├── product-spec.md                        # Your product requirements
├── technical-spec.md                      # Technical implementation plan
├── progress.json                          # Ticket tracking and phase status
├── manual-setup.md                        # Manual steps (generated in Phase 4)
├── agent-written-specifications/          # AI-generated tech specs
├── completed-tickets-documentation/       # Docs for completed tickets
└── qa-screenshots/                        # QA test evidence
```

The folder slug uses the format `YYMMDD-feature-name` (e.g., `260206-user-auth-flow`).

## Skipping phases

The workflow is flexible. If you already have specs written, you can import them and jump ahead. p0 detects existing content and adjusts accordingly. You can also pause at any phase, make manual changes, and resume where you left off.

<Note>
  The spec-driven workflow is designed for substantial features. For small tweaks and bug fixes, regular chat mode (Agent or Plan mode) may be more efficient.

The refine phase gives you a dedicated environment to improve your specs before implementation begins. Work in a split-screen layout with your spec editor on the left and an AI chat on the right.

## Layout

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the Phase 2 interface showing the spec editor on the left with tabs and the AI chat on the right, with the readiness meter visible */}

The refine phase uses a resizable split-screen layout:

- **Left panel (70%)** — spec editor with tabs for Product Spec, Technical Spec, and Attachments
- **Right panel (30%)** — AI chat for refining your specs collaboratively
- **Resizable divider** — drag to adjust the split between editor and chat

## Spec editor

The editor supports three tabs:

### Product spec tab

Edit your product requirements directly. The editor supports Markdown formatting and auto-saves to `{featurePath}/product-spec.md` as you type.

### Technical spec tab (optional)

Add implementation details like architecture decisions, API design, database changes, and component structure. Saved to `{featurePath}/technical-spec.md`.

### Attachments tab

Manage uploaded images and visual references. You can:

- View all attached images
- Add new images via paste or drag-and-drop
- Insert image references into your specs

## Readiness meter

A visual indicator shows how comprehensive your product spec is:

| Color | Character count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Red | Under 100 | Needs more detail |
| Orange | 100–499 | Getting started |
| Yellow | 500–1,499 | Decent coverage |
| Green | 1,500+ | Comprehensive |

The meter updates in real-time as you edit. A more detailed spec leads to better implementation results.

## AI refinement

Use the chat panel to refine your specs collaboratively:

- Ask the AI to expand on specific sections
- Request user stories or acceptance criteria
- Get feedback on completeness and clarity
- Have the AI rewrite sections based on your direction

The AI can update your product spec content directly based on the conversation.

<Tip>
  The more detail you provide in your specs, the better the implementation will be. Take time to think through edge cases, acceptance criteria, and technical constraints before moving to Phase 3.
</Tip>

## Moving to Phase 3

When you're satisfied with your specs, click the **Go!** button (bottom right) to save your specs and start implementation. Both the product spec and technical spec are written to disk before Phase 3 begins.

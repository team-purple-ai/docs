description: "Plan the architecture, file changes, and dependencies before writing code"
---

The tech spec translates product requirements into an engineering plan. It breaks down the feature into concrete file changes, identifies dependencies, and outlines the implementation approach.

## What's in a tech spec

A comprehensive tech spec includes:

### Architecture decisions

- Component structure and relationships
- Data flow and state management
- API design and integration points
- Database schema changes

### File-by-file change plan

A detailed breakdown of which files need to be created, modified, or deleted, including:

- New files to create
- Existing files to modify
- Functions and components to add or change
- Tests to write

### Dependencies

- New packages to install
- Version requirements
- Potential conflicts

### Risk assessment

- Technical challenges
- Areas requiring careful review
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

## Generating the tech spec

Use `/engineer-tasks` to generate a tech spec from your product spec, or let the full pipeline generate it automatically.

p0 analyzes your codebase to:

- Identify existing patterns to follow
- Find similar implementations for reference
- Detect potential conflicts
- Suggest appropriate file locations

## Reviewing and editing

The tech spec is your last checkpoint before code changes begin. Review it carefully to ensure:

- The approach aligns with your codebase conventions
- All requirements from the product spec are addressed
- Dependencies are appropriate
- The scope is manageable

You can request changes, add details, or approve to proceed to implementation.

<Note>
  The tech spec is your last checkpoint before code changes begin. Take time to review the implementation plan carefully.
</Note>

## Implementation approach

The tech spec can outline different implementation strategies:

- **Sequential**: One file at a time, in dependency order
- **Parallel**: Multiple files simultaneously (via `/orchestrate`)
- **Incremental**: Build in testable stages

## Next steps

Once the tech spec is approved, p0 moves to Phase 3: Implementation.

p0 executes the tech spec, making file edits, running commands, and testing as it goes. You have full visibility into every action, with the ability to intervene at any time.

## Real-time monitoring

Watch tool execution as it happens:

- **Bash commands**: See commands run, view output, check exit codes
- **File edits**: View exact changes with before/after diffs
- **Test runs**: Monitor test execution and results
- **Grep/search operations**: See what p0 is looking for and finding

Each tool call shows:

- Input parameters
- Execution status
- Output or results
- Duration

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the implementation phase with multiple tool calls visible, showing Edit and Bash tools in action */}

## Parallel execution

For features with multiple independent files, use `/orchestrate` to run parallel implementation. p0 will:

- Identify independent work streams
- Execute file changes concurrently
- Coordinate dependencies
- Merge results safely

This dramatically speeds up implementation for larger features.

## Intervention

You can pause, redirect, or ask questions at any point during implementation:

- Stop execution to review changes
- Ask why p0 made a specific choice
- Request a different approach
- Point out errors before they propagate

<Tip>
  Use the session diff viewer to monitor cumulative changes as implementation progresses.
</Tip>

## Tool execution

p0 uses a variety of tools during implementation:

- **Edit**: Make precise changes to existing files
- **Write**: Create new files
- **Bash**: Run commands, tests, and scripts
- **Read**: View file contents
- **Grep**: Search for patterns across files
- **Glob**: Find files by pattern

## Testing and verification

Throughout implementation, p0:

- Runs tests after changes
- Checks for syntax errors
- Verifies imports and dependencies
- Ensures code follows project conventions

<Warning>
  Review the session diff carefully before moving to the PR phase. This is your chance to catch issues before they enter version control.
</Warning>

## Next steps

When implementation is complete, move to Phase 4 to review changes and create a pull request.

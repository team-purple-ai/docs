In the watch phase, the AI implements your spec while you monitor progress. You get a real-time view of every action taken, organized by tickets in a progress tree.

## Layout

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/watch-phase.png" alt="Phase 3 watch mode with stream and ticket tree" />
</Frame>

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the Phase 3 interface showing the streaming implementation on the left and the ticket tree on the right with some completed and in-progress tickets */}

The watch phase uses a resizable split-screen layout:

- **Left panel (65%)** — real-time streaming output showing the AI's work
- **Right panel (35%)** — ticket tree showing implementation progress

## Streaming output

The left panel shows everything the AI is doing in real-time:

- **Bash commands** — see commands run with full output and exit codes
- **File edits** — view exact changes with syntax-highlighted diffs
- **File creation** — new files being written
- **Search operations** — what the AI is looking for and finding
- **Reasoning** — the AI's thought process between actions

The stream uses the same rendering as the regular chat interface, so you get full tool visualization with expandable output.

## Ticket tree

The right panel tracks implementation progress organized into phases and tickets:

- **Phases** — high-level implementation stages (collapsible)
- **Tickets** — individual tasks within each phase
- **Status indicators**:
  - Green checkmark — completed
  - Yellow spinner — in progress
  - Red X — failed (with error description)
- **Progress badge** — shows completed/total tickets per phase (e.g., "3/5")

The ticket tree reads from the `progress.json` file in your feature folder, which the AI updates as it works.

## Intervening

You can pause and redirect the AI at any time:

1. Click **Stop** to pause execution
2. A blue banner appears: "Claude finished. Send a message to continue..."
3. Type feedback, corrections, or new instructions
4. The AI resumes with your input taken into account

This is useful when you spot an issue early or want to adjust the approach mid-implementation.

## Parallel execution

For features with independent work streams, the `/orchestrate` command enables parallel implementation:

- Multiple files and components built concurrently
- Dependencies coordinated automatically
- Results merged safely

This significantly speeds up implementation for larger features.

<Tip>
  You don't need to watch the entire implementation. p0 will automatically transition to Phase 4 when the implementation is complete.
</Tip>

## Automatic transition

Phase 3 transitions to Phase 4 automatically when the AI signals completion. The transition is triggered by either:

- The AI signaling build completion
- A `manual-setup.md` file appearing in the feature folder

If automatic detection doesn't trigger, a **Mark Complete** button on the ticket tree lets you manually advance.

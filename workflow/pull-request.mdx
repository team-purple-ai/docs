After the AI finishes implementing your spec, review the changes and complete any manual setup steps before creating pull requests.

## Layout

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/review-phase.png" alt="Phase 4 review with implementation stream and manual setup" />
</Frame>

{/* TODO: Screenshot - capture the Phase 4 interface showing the implementation stream on the left and the manual setup panel on the right, with the "Create PR/s" button visible at the bottom */}

The review phase shows:

- **Left panel (50%)** — the implementation stream (preserved from Phase 3) so you can review what was done
- **Right panel (50%)** — manual setup panel showing any steps you need to complete before creating the PR

## Manual setup steps

If the implementation requires manual configuration (e.g., environment variables, service credentials, or database migrations), the AI generates a `manual-setup.md` file with instructions. This appears in the right panel as a checklist you can follow.

Common manual setup steps include:

- Setting environment variables
- Configuring third-party services
- Running database migrations
- Updating deployment configurations
- Generating API keys

## PR description generation

When you click **Create PR/s**, p0 generates a comprehensive PR description based on:

- Your product spec
- Completed ticket documentation from `completed-tickets-documentation/`
- AI-generated specifications from `agent-written-specifications/`

The description is generated by Claude and formatted as Markdown. If generation takes too long (over 15 seconds), a fallback description is used instead.

## Multi-repo PRs

For workspaces with multiple repositories, p0 creates one PR per repository that has changes:

- Each repo gets its own PR with the same description
- PRs are tracked independently (separate URLs and statuses)
- Failed repos can be retried individually in Phase 5

## Creating the PR

Click **Create PR/s** at the bottom of the screen. p0 will:

1. Collect all feature folder documentation
2. Generate the PR description
3. Create a PR in each repository with changes
4. Store PR metadata for tracking
5. Transition to Phase 5

<Note>
  Make sure you've completed any manual setup steps before creating the PR. The manual setup panel is your checklist for pre-PR tasks.

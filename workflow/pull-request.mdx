After implementation, review all changes in the session diff and create a pull request. p0 provides comprehensive diff viewing and generates PR descriptions based on your specs.

## Reviewing the diff

p0 shows a full diff of all changes made during implementation. You can view changes in multiple ways:

- **Tree view**: See files organized by directory structure
- **Grouped view**: See files grouped by change type (modified, created, deleted)
- **Unified diff**: Traditional side-by-side comparison
- **Split view**: Changes displayed in parallel panes

The diff viewer highlights:

- Lines added and removed
- File creation and deletion
- Moved or renamed files
- Binary file changes

## PR description

p0 generates a comprehensive PR description based on:

- The product spec (what was built)
- The tech spec (how it was built)
- The actual changes made
- Test results and verification

The description typically includes:

- Summary of changes
- Key implementation details
- Testing performed
- Deployment notes or considerations

You can edit the description before creating the PR.

## Multi-repo PRs

For multi-repo workspaces, p0 can create pull requests across multiple repositories:

- Detects which repos have changes
- Creates coordinated PRs
- Links related PRs together
- Ensures dependency order

This is particularly useful for features that span frontend/backend or multiple services.

## Pushing changes

You have several options for getting your changes into version control:

### Push from p0

Let p0 push the changes directly to your remote repository. It will:

- Create a feature branch
- Commit all changes
- Push to origin
- Create the PR via GitHub CLI

### Manual push

If you prefer more control:

1. Review the session diff
2. Exit p0 and use your git workflow
3. Commit and push manually
4. Create PR through GitHub web UI

<Note>
  p0 uses worktrees to isolate session changes. Make sure you understand how the worktree maps to your main repository before pushing.

## PR checklist

Before creating the PR, verify:

- All tests pass
- Code follows project conventions
- No unintended files included
- Sensitive data not exposed
- PR description is accurate

## Next steps

After the PR is created, move to Phase 5 to handle review feedback.

Plan mode lets p0 analyze your code without modifying anything. It's great for understanding the scope and complexity of a task before committing to changes.

## How it works

When p0 is in Plan mode, it can read and analyze your codebase but cannot execute commands or modify files. The AI will:

1. Explore your codebase using read-only tools
2. Analyze the requirements and current implementation
3. Create a detailed plan outlining the steps needed
4. Present the plan for your review and approval

This read-only analysis gives you a clear roadmap before any changes are made to your code.

## Available tools

In Plan mode, p0 has access to these read-only tools:

- **Read** - View file contents
- **Grep** - Search for patterns in files
- **Glob** - Find files by name patterns
- **WebSearch** - Search the web for information
- **WebFetch** - Fetch content from URLs
- **Task** - Break down complex analysis tasks
- **Thinking** - Internal reasoning about the problem

These tools allow comprehensive code analysis without the ability to modify anything.

## When to use Plan mode

Plan mode is ideal for:

- **Complex tasks** - Understanding multi-step changes before execution
- **Unfamiliar codebases** - Exploring architecture and patterns first
- **Multi-file changes** - Mapping out dependencies and impact
- **Architecture decisions** - Evaluating different approaches before implementing

Starting in Plan mode helps you avoid surprises and ensures the AI understands your requirements correctly.

## Switching to Agent mode

After reviewing the plan, you have two options:

1. **Approve the plan** - p0 will automatically switch to Agent mode and send an "Implement plan" message to execute the proposed changes
2. **Use the /agent command** - Manually switch to Agent mode at any time

Once in Agent mode, p0 can execute the plan by running commands and modifying files.

<Tip>
Start every new task in Plan mode to get a roadmap before making changes. You can switch to Plan mode at any time by typing `/plan` in the chat.

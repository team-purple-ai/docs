Sub-chats let you run multiple parallel conversations within the same p0 session. Each sub-chat is an independent thread with its own conversation history and context.

## Creating a sub-chat

To create a new sub-chat within your current session:

- Type `/clear` in the chat to start a fresh conversation thread
- The new sub-chat opens as a tab alongside your existing threads
- Start chatting with p0 in the new thread

All sub-chats within a session share the same git worktree but maintain independent conversation histories.

## Managing sub-chats

Sub-chats appear as tabs in the session interface, making it easy to navigate between different conversations:

- **Tab navigation** - Click tabs to switch between sub-chats
- **Pinning** - Pin important sub-chats to keep them easily accessible
- **Renaming** - Give sub-chats descriptive names to organize your work

Each sub-chat maintains its own metadata including ID, name, creation timestamp, and mode.

## Independent modes

Each sub-chat can operate in its own mode independently:

- Sub-chat A could be in **Plan mode** exploring a new feature
- Sub-chat B could be in **Agent mode** implementing a bug fix
- Sub-chat C could be in **Plan mode** analyzing architecture options

The mode setting is stored per sub-chat and persists across sessions using localStorage.

## Use cases

Sub-chats are useful for:

- **Exploring different approaches** - Try multiple solutions in parallel and compare results
- **Separating concerns** - Have one sub-chat for frontend changes and another for backend
- **Quick questions** - Ask questions without interrupting your main implementation thread
- **Parallel tasks** - Work on multiple independent features simultaneously
- **Documentation** - Keep a sub-chat for documentation updates separate from code changes

<Tip>
Use sub-chats to keep your main conversation focused while exploring side questions or alternative approaches. You can always merge insights back into your primary thread.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigate between sub-chats quickly:

| Shortcut | Action |

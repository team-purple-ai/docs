---

p0's AI uses tools to interact with your codebase. Every tool call is visible with real-time output, giving you complete transparency into what the AI is doing.

## What are tools

Tools are capabilities the AI uses to accomplish tasks — reading files, running commands, editing code, searching the web. Each tool call shows:

- **Inputs**: The parameters passed to the tool
- **Outputs**: The results returned by the tool
- **Status**: Whether the tool succeeded or failed

Every action the AI takes goes through a tool. Nothing happens invisibly.

## Real-time visualization

p0 visualizes tool execution with animated status indicators:

- **Pending**: Shimmer animation while the tool is queued
- **Running**: Animated purple border during execution
- **Success**: Green checkmark when the tool completes successfully
- **Error**: Red indicator with error details if the tool fails

This lifecycle visualization helps you understand exactly what's happening at any moment.

## Tool categories

p0 provides 27+ tool types organized into categories:

  <Card title="File operations" icon="file">
    Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob for working with your codebase
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execution" icon="terminal">
    Bash commands with streaming output and exit codes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web" icon="globe">
    WebSearch and WebFetch for external documentation and APIs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Planning" icon="list-check">
    Task (subagents), TodoWrite, PlanWrite, and Thinking for complex workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permission model

p0 uses a permission model to control tool access:

- **Plan mode**: Read-only tools only (Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch). The AI can explore but cannot make changes.
- **Agent mode**: All tools enabled. The AI can edit files, run commands, and make changes to your codebase.

This ensures you maintain control over when the AI can modify your project.

<Note>
You can switch between Plan and Agent modes at any time using `/plan` or `/agent` in the chat.

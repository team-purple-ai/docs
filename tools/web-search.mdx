p0 can search the web when it needs external context — documentation, API references, error solutions, or information beyond its training data.

## How it works

The AI has two web tools:

### WebSearch

Returns a list of search results with titles and URLs:

- The AI constructs a search query based on what it needs
- Returns up to 10 results with titles, URLs, and snippets
- The AI can choose which results to fetch for detailed content

### WebFetch

Retrieves full page content from specific URLs:

- Fetches the complete content of a web page
- Returns hostname, byte size, and HTTP status
- Content is converted to markdown for easier processing

The AI decides when to search and which results to fetch based on the task.

## Result display

Search results appear as an expandable list:

- **Expandable results**: Click to expand and see all results
- **Title and URL**: Each result shows the page title and URL
- **Link icon**: Visual indicator that these are web resources
- **Clickable URLs**: Click any URL to open it in your browser

## When AI searches

The AI typically performs web searches for:

- **Unfamiliar APIs**: Looking up API documentation for libraries it hasn't seen before
- **Error messages**: Finding solutions to cryptic error messages or stack traces
- **Library documentation**: Checking the latest syntax or usage patterns for a framework
- **Explicit requests**: When you ask it to search for something specific

The AI uses its judgment about when external information would be helpful.

<Note>
The AI is trained on data up to a certain cutoff date. Web search allows it to access current documentation, recent changes, and real-time information.
</Note>

## Privacy

Web searches are performed through Purple's API with privacy protections:

- **Search terms only**: Only the search query is sent, never your code
- **No code context**: Your codebase content stays local and is not included in searches
- **Secure fetching**: WebFetch retrieves pages over HTTPS

For more details on how p0 protects your data, see the [Security and Privacy](/reference/security-and-privacy) documentation.

<Tip>
You can see exactly what the AI searched for in the tool call. This transparency helps you understand what external context it's using.

The session diff viewer shows all file changes made during a session, organized by directory structure or change type. This gives you a complete overview of what the AI has modified.

## Accessing the diff

Open the diff viewer in two ways:

- Click the **diff icon** in the session header
- Open the **sidebar** and navigate to the Diff tab

The diff viewer is available at any time during or after a session.

## View modes

Choose between two organizational modes:

### Tree mode

Files are organized by directory structure:

- Mirrors your project's folder hierarchy
- Expandable/collapsible directories
- Easy to see changes in a specific part of your codebase

### Grouped mode

Files are grouped by change type:

- **Modified**: Files that were edited
- **Created**: New files that were added
- **Deleted**: Files that were removed

Switch between modes using the view selector at the top of the diff viewer.

## Diff display

The diff viewer supports two display styles:

### Unified view

Single column showing additions and removals inline:

- **Green lines**: Additions (prefixed with +)
- **Red lines**: Removals (prefixed with -)
- **White lines**: Unchanged context

### Split view

Side-by-side comparison:

- **Left side**: Original content
- **Right side**: Modified content
- **Synchronized scrolling**: Both sides scroll together

## Navigating changes

Click any file in the list to jump to its diff:

- **Instant navigation**: The diff scrolls to show the selected file
- **Highlighted changes**: Additions in green, removals in red
- **Context**: See surrounding unchanged code for context

This makes it easy to review changes across multiple files quickly.

<Tip>
Use the diff viewer before committing changes to review everything the AI did in a session. It's like `git diff` but organized by the AI's work.

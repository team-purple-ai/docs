p0 can create new files and make precise edits to existing ones, showing every change as a syntax-highlighted diff so you can verify exactly what changed.

## Edit tool

The Edit tool makes targeted edits to existing files:

- **Find and replace**: The AI specifies the exact text to find and what to replace it with
- **Syntax-highlighted diff**: Changes are shown with Shiki syntax highlighting in the file's language
- **Line counts**: The header displays +/- line counts (e.g., "+5 -2" means 5 lines added, 2 removed)
- **Clickable filename**: Click the filename to open the full diff in the sidebar

The Edit tool is precise — the AI must match the exact text to replace, ensuring edits happen exactly where intended.

## Write tool

The Write tool creates new files or replaces entire file contents:

- **New files**: Create files that don't exist yet
- **Full replacements**: Replace the entire contents of an existing file
- **Path display**: Shows the full file path and content preview

Use Write for new files, Edit for targeted changes to existing files.

## Diff preview

Every edit shows a before/after diff:

- **Green highlighting**: Added lines and characters
- **Red highlighting**: Removed lines and characters
- **Context lines**: Unchanged lines around the edit for context
- **Inline changes**: Character-level diffs show exactly what changed within a line

This visual feedback lets you verify changes before accepting them.

## Notebook editing

The NotebookEdit tool works with Jupyter notebooks:

- **Cell-level edits**: Replace, insert, or delete individual cells
- **Code and markdown**: Supports both code and markdown cells
- **Cell IDs**: Target specific cells by their ID

Notebooks are stored as JSON, but NotebookEdit abstracts away the complexity.

<Tip>
Click any filename in a tool call to see the full file diff in the sidebar. This is especially useful for understanding edits in context.

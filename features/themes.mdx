## Built-in themes

p0 includes several carefully designed themes:

### Dark themes

- **Purple Deep** (default) — Rich purple backgrounds with high contrast, optimized for extended coding sessions
- **Purple Minimal** — Subtle purple accents on dark gray for a more understated look
- **Cursor Dark** — Clean dark theme inspired by Cursor IDE
- **Cursor Midnight** — Deep blue-black theme for late-night coding
- **GitHub Dark** — Familiar dark theme matching GitHub's interface

### Light themes

- **Cursor Light** — Bright, clean theme for well-lit environments
- **GitHub Light** — Classic light theme matching GitHub's interface

Each theme is designed to provide excellent readability and reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## System preference

Set your theme mode to **System** to automatically switch between your chosen light and dark themes based on your operating system's appearance setting.

For example, you can configure:
- Dark theme: Purple Deep
- Light theme: GitHub Light
- Mode: System

p0 will then automatically switch between these themes when you change your system appearance, ensuring optimal visibility in any lighting condition.

## VS Code theme compatibility

p0 supports VS Code TextMate themes for syntax highlighting, giving you access to hundreds of popular themes from the VS Code ecosystem.

Popular VS Code themes available in p0 include:
- Material Theme variants
- Vitesse (light and dark)
- Poimandres
- Slack theme
- Dracula
- One Dark Pro
- And many more

The syntax highlighting engine uses Shiki, providing accurate and beautiful code coloring across all supported languages.

## What themes affect

Themes in p0 control the appearance of:

- **UI colors** — Sidebar, settings panels, dialogs, buttons

- **Code syntax highlighting** — Keywords, strings, comments, functions across all languages
- **Diff viewer** — Added, removed, and modified line colors

This comprehensive theming ensures a consistent visual experience throughout the application.

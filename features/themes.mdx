p0 supports multiple color themes that affect the entire application — from the UI and terminal to code syntax highlighting. Choose a theme that matches your preferences and working environment.

## Built-in themes

p0 includes several carefully designed themes:

### Purple themes

- **Purple Deep** (default) — Rich purple backgrounds (`#0d0619`) with bright purple borders, designed for extended sessions
- **Purple Minimal** — Black and gray (`#0a0a0a`) with subtle purple accents
- **Purple Light** — Light mode (`#ffffff`) with purple accent colors

### Dark themes

- **Claude Dark** — Warm dark tones with orange accent
- **Vesper Dark** — Clean dark with orange accent
- **Vitesse Dark** — Neutral dark
- **Min Dark** — Minimal dark
- **Cursor Dark** — Clean dark theme inspired by Cursor IDE
- **Cursor Midnight** — Deep blue-black for late-night coding

### Light themes

- **Claude Light** — Warm beige with orange accent
- **Vitesse Light** — Clean light
- **Min Light** — Minimal light
- **Cursor Light** — Bright, clean for well-lit environments

Each theme is designed to provide excellent readability and reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## System preference

Set your theme mode to **System** to automatically switch between your chosen light and dark themes based on your operating system's appearance setting.

For example, you can configure:
- Dark theme: Purple Deep
- Light theme: GitHub Light
- Mode: System

p0 will then automatically switch between these themes when you change your system appearance, ensuring optimal visibility in any lighting condition.

## VS Code theme compatibility

p0 uses the VS Code theme format internally. All 13 built-in themes map to VS Code theme color tokens, which means:

- **Full CSS variable support** — every VS Code color key is mapped to a CSS custom property
- **Shiki syntax highlighting** — code blocks use the selected theme for accurate, beautiful syntax coloring across all supported languages
- **Terminal integration** — terminal ANSI colors are extracted from the theme, so your terminal matches the rest of the app

## What themes affect

Themes in p0 control the appearance of:

- **UI colors** — Sidebar, settings panels, dialogs, buttons
- **Terminal colors** — Background, foreground, and all 16 ANSI colors
- **Code syntax highlighting** — Keywords, strings, comments, functions across all languages
- **Diff viewer** — Added, removed, and modified line colors
- **Chat interface** — Message bubbles, code blocks, inline code

This comprehensive theming ensures a consistent visual experience throughout the application.

## Changing your theme

To change your theme:

1. Open Settings with `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux)
2. Navigate to **Appearance**
3. Select your preferred theme from the dropdown
4. The change takes effect immediately

You can also access the theme picker through the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) by typing "theme".

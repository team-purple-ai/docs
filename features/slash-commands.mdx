## Session commands

Control your current chat session and context:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Switch to Plan mode for strategic thinking and high-level design |
| `/agent` | Switch to Agent mode for autonomous task execution |
| `/clear` | Start a new sub-chat while preserving conversation context |
| `/compact` | Compact conversation context to reduce token usage |

**Use cases:**
- Use `/plan` when you need to think through architecture or design decisions before coding
- Use `/agent` to let p0 work autonomously on implementing features
- Use `/clear` to start fresh without losing important context from earlier in the session
- Use `/compact` when approaching context limits to condense the conversation

## Code review commands

Analyze and audit your code:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review` | Comprehensive code review with suggestions for improvements |
| `/pr-comments` | Generate review comments for a pull request |
| `/release-notes` | Generate release notes from recent commits and changes |
| `/security-review` | Security-focused audit looking for vulnerabilities |

**Use cases:**

| `/orchestrate` | Parallel implementation of engineering tasks from spec |
| `/refine` | Incremental changes and improvements to existing features |
| `/create-standards` | Generate coding standards by analyzing your codebase |
| `/review-standards` | Review code for compliance with workspace coding standards |

**Use cases:**

- Use `/engineer-tasks` to break down specs into actionable engineering tasks
- Use `/orchestrate` to implement multiple tasks in parallel
- Use `/refine` for iterative improvements to existing code
- Use `/create-standards` to document your team's coding patterns

| `/doctor` | Run diagnostics to check installation health |
| `/mcp` | Manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers |
| `/config` | View current workspace and app configuration |
| `/permissions` | Manage tool permissions and security settings |
| `/status` | Show current session status and active context |
| `/vim` | Toggle vim keybindings in the chat input |

**Use cases:**
- Use `/model` to switch to Opus for complex tasks or Haiku for simple queries
- Check `/cost` to monitor token usage and stay within budget
- Use `/memory` to view what p0 has remembered across sessions
- Run `/doctor` if you're experiencing issues
- Use `/mcp` to add tools and integrations via MCP servers
- Use `/permissions` to review what tools p0 can access
- Use `/vim` if you prefer vim keybindings for text editing

## Custom commands from plugins

Installed plugins can add their own slash commands. These appear in the autocomplete dropdown with a plugin icon and are documented in the plugin's description.

To see all available commands including those from plugins, type `/` in the chat input or use the `/help` command.

<Tip>
Type `/` in the chat input to see the autocomplete dropdown with all available commands, their descriptions, and keyboard shortcuts. Start typing to filter commands by name.
</Tip>

## Command shortcuts

Many commands have keyboard shortcuts for faster access:

- **Cmd+K** (macOS) / **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) — Equivalent to `/clear`
- **Cmd+Shift+P** (macOS) / **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Windows/Linux) — Command palette with all actions

For the complete list of keyboard shortcuts, see [keyboard shortcuts](/features/keyboard-shortcuts).

Coding standards tell p0 how your team writes code — capturing your style guides, architectural patterns, and conventions. When configured, p0 uses these standards to write code that matches your team's practices and to review existing code for consistency.

## How standards work

Standards are instructions for the AI that influence how p0:
- Writes new code and features
- Reviews and refactors existing code
- Suggests improvements and best practices
- Generates tests and documentation

Standards are stored per workspace, so each project can have its own conventions. When you switch workspaces, p0 automatically applies the appropriate standards.

## Standard categories

p0 organizes coding standards into eight categories to provide targeted guidance:

### Global
Applies to all code across your project. Use this for universal conventions like:
- Naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
- File organization and structure
- Error handling patterns
- Logging and monitoring practices

### Frontend
UI and client-side patterns for web applications:
- Component structure (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- State management patterns (Redux, Zustand, Pinia)
- CSS methodologies (BEM, CSS Modules, Tailwind)
- Accessibility requirements (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### Backend
Server-side and API patterns:
- API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Database interaction patterns (ORMs, query builders)
- Authentication and authorization approaches
- Middleware and request handling

### Business
Domain logic and business rules:
- Domain model conventions
- Business process workflows
- Validation rules and constraints
- Integration patterns with external systems

### Mobile
Mobile-specific patterns and conventions:
- Platform-specific guidelines (iOS, Android, React Native)
- Navigation patterns
- Offline-first strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Data
Data science and machine learning patterns:
- Data pipeline conventions
- Model training and evaluation practices
- Feature engineering approaches
- Notebook organization and documentation

### DevOps
Infrastructure and CI/CD patterns:
- Deployment strategies
- Container and orchestration conventions
- Infrastructure as code patterns
- Monitoring and observability practices

### Security
Security best practices:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and session management
- Secrets management
- Security testing requirements

## Setting up standards

There are several ways to establish coding standards in your workspace:

### From templates
When creating a workspace, select a template that includes pre-configured standards for common tech stacks (React, Next.js, Python/FastAPI, etc.).

### Generate with AI
Use the `/create-standards` command to have p0 analyze your existing codebase and generate standards based on observed patterns.

### Manual configuration
Navigate to workspace settings and edit standards directly. Each category has a rich text editor where you can write or paste your team's guidelines.

### Import from documentation
Copy and paste relevant sections from your team's existing style guides or documentation.

## Team sync

When you're part of a Purple team, coding standards automatically sync across your organization. This ensures:
- All team members use consistent conventions
- New team members get up to speed quickly
- Standards updates propagate to everyone
- Projects maintain consistency across different workspaces

Standards sync happens in the background — no manual intervention required.

<Tip>
Use `/review-standards` to check existing code against your workspace standards. p0 will identify inconsistencies and suggest improvements to align with your conventions.

## Best practices

For effective coding standards:

- **Be specific** — Instead of "use good naming", specify "use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes"
- **Provide examples** — Show code examples of correct and incorrect patterns
- **Keep them current** — Update standards as your team's practices evolve
- **Start small** — Begin with critical conventions and expand over time
- **Make them discoverable** — Reference external documentation URLs for detailed guidelines

Plugins add custom agents, commands, and tools to your p0 workspace. They enable you to extend p0's functionality with specialized capabilities tailored to your workflow, tech stack, or team practices.

## Plugin types

p0 supports two plugin distribution methods:

### Tarball plugins
Downloadable packages distributed as `.tar.gz` files. These are versioned, immutable packages that can be downloaded and installed directly from Purple's plugin registry or custom sources.

**Advantages:**
- Versioned and reproducible
- Offline installation possible
- Fast installation (no git clone required)

### Repository plugins
Git-based plugins installed directly from a repository URL. These are ideal for development, private plugins, or team-specific extensions.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to develop and iterate
- Can be private repositories
- Simple updates (git pull)

## Installing plugins

### During workspace creation
When creating a new workspace, p0 shows available plugins relevant to your selected template. Check the boxes for plugins you want to include.

### From Settings
1. Open Settings with `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux)
2. Navigate to **Plugins**
3. Browse the plugin gallery
4. Click **Install** on any plugin you want to add

Installation happens automatically — p0 downloads the plugin, validates its manifest, and registers it in your workspace.

## Plugin structure

When you install a plugin, p0 adds files to your workspace's `.claude` directory:

```
.claude/
├── agents/           # Custom agent definitions
│   └── my-agent.json
├── commands/         # Custom slash commands
│   └── my-command.js
└── plugins/
    └── {plugin-id}/
        └── manifest.json  # Plugin metadata and dependencies
```

**Agents** add new AI personas with specialized prompts and capabilities. They appear in the agent selector and can be invoked via commands.

**Commands** add new slash commands that appear in the `/` autocomplete. They can trigger workflows, run scripts, or invoke agents.

**Manifest** describes the plugin's metadata, dependencies, and required permissions. p0 validates the manifest before installation.

The plugin structure is synced with your workspace's `purple.json` file, which tracks all installed plugins and their configuration.

## Managing plugins

### Enable/disable
Toggle plugins on or off without uninstalling. Disabled plugins remain in your workspace but don't load their agents or commands.

1. Go to Settings > Plugins
2. Find the plugin in your installed list
3. Toggle the enable/disable switch

### Uninstall
Remove a plugin and all its files from your workspace:

1. Go to Settings > Plugins
2. Find the plugin in your installed list
3. Click **Uninstall**
4. Confirm the action

This removes all agent definitions, commands, and the plugin directory from `.claude/`.

### Reinstall for updates
To update a plugin to its latest version:

1. Uninstall the current version
2. Install it again from the plugin browser

p0 will fetch the latest version. Note: this only applies to tarball plugins. Repository plugins can be updated with `git pull` in the plugin directory.

### Per-workspace enablement
Plugins are workspace-scoped. Installing a plugin in one workspace doesn't affect other workspaces. This allows different projects to have different tooling without conflicts.

## Plugin discovery

Browse available plugins from Purple's plugin registry in the plugin browser. Plugins are categorized by:

- **Development tools** — Formatters, linters, testing utilities
- **Frameworks** — Framework-specific agents and commands
- **Workflows** — Automation and process helpers
- **Integrations** — Connections to external services and APIs
- **Team plugins** — Custom plugins shared by your organization

The plugin browser shows:
- Plugin name and description
- Version and author
- Installation count and ratings
- Required dependencies
- Permissions needed

<Tip>
Plugin permissions are managed through p0's permission system. When a plugin requests file access, network access, or other capabilities, you'll be prompted to approve the permissions.

## Creating plugins

Custom plugins can be created and shared with your team:

- Install from a git repository URL
- Share with your organization via Purple's registry
- Develop locally and iterate using repository-type plugins
